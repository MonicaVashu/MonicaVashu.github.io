I am glad you're here! 

I am a Software Developer with 3+ years of experience in Backend Engineering and a Machine Learning Enthusiast. 
Recently I worked with Amazon in their Amazon Web Services (AWS) organization as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) and contributed to building a largely used File system service called [Amazon FSx](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/). My challenges as a SDE in AWS included developing, optimizing and designing solutions that scale and are resilent to the nature of distributed systems. Having learnt about Distributed systems from [Dr. Steve Ko](https://nsr.cse.buffalo.edu/?page_id=272), I was thrilled at the opportunity of being able to see things in action at AWS. I did my Masters in Computer Science in 2020 from the [State University of New York at Buffalo, NY, USA](http://www.buffalo.edu/) and I specialized in Machine learning. 

Prior to that I worked with [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/in-en) as Software Engineer and built web systems for UK and US based clients. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering in 2016 from [Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology](https://vesit.ves.ac.in/) affiliated to [Mumbai University](https://mu.ac.in/). 

During my leisure time, I enjoy practicing yoga, hula hooping, dancing, baking. 
I also like to write, you can checkout my personal blog [here](https://motica351.wordpress.com/). 

I believe in giving back to the society and for that mission of mine, I help students navigate through the journey of landing as a Software Developer in Top Technology companies like FAANG through various ways possible. To learn about my work, let's [chat 1-1](https://calendly.com/monicakherajani/15-minute-1-1-meeting) and see how I can help you! 

Hope to talk to you soon!
